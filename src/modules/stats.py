"""
stats.py — Statistical tests for the EKF / solver pipeline.

Three tests, all χ² under their null hypotheses:

  - feature_nis_gate         : per-feature stationarity test (§sec:feature_movement)
  - joint_consistency        : group-level inlier consistency (§sec:feature_movement)
  - admission_velocity_gate  : pre-EKF velocity test for new features (§sec:mono_admission_stats)

All confidence levels (alpha_NIS, alpha_adm) read from algorithm.yaml.
No hardcoded thresholds.

PERF NOTE: feature_nis_gate currently computes innovations and innovation
covariances. Then the EKF computes equivalent quantities inside update() to build the gain.
A future optimisation pass should, eliminating the duplicate work.
